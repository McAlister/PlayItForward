    <p>
    We have an exciting announcement about our sponsored bounty for GP San Jose and
    GP Toronto! The top female/nonbinary player will receive a gorgeous playmat featuring
    artwork by Max Collins, an artist and animator at Cartoon Network and Studio Yotta.
    Max is crazy talented and kind enough to donate artwork to us. You can check out his
    work on <a href="http://maxjcollins.tumblr.com/">his tumblr</a>.  The playmats for GP
    San Jose and GP Toronto are sponsored by <a href="http://gamermats.com/">
    GamerMats</a>. GamerMats is your source for the highest quality playmats.  They provide custom
    mats for tournament organizers, artists, and individuals. GamerMats rule!

    Last but not least: we now have <a ui-sref="mailingList">an email list</a>. If you would like
    to receive updates about future bounties - or if you'd like to donate a piece of original artwork
    for a playmat - please sign up.  It would also be very helpful to sign up if you are competing
    for the GP San Jose playmat as having your name and contact will make it easier to find you and

    See you at GP San Jose! We don't have a table because we'll be playing in the main event.
