        The top female/nonbinary player will receive a gorgeous playmat featuring artwork by
        <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artist/merkerinn/profile">Malwina Kwiatkowska</a>
        (merkerinn on facebook). She's a gifted digital artist from Poland who specializes in concept art, 3D
        modeling, and fan art. She also streams her work on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/merkerinn">Twitch</a>,
        which is pretty dang cool! As always the mats themselves are
        provided by our heroes at <a href="http://gamermats.com/">GamerMats</a>.  Check them out if you want a
        playmat that is all your own.
