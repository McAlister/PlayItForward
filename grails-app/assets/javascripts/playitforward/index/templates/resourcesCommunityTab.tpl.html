                Breaking down the barriers of entry into Magic is the number one goal of the group, but we also
                aim to provide a stepping-stone into tournament play.

                With over 100 chapters in the world, this group has been very successful and continues to grow.
                The group teaches Magic at many conventions with a large, dedicated staff of experienced teachers.
