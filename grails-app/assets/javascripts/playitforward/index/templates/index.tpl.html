        Welcome to Play It Forward. Our goal? Get more women on the Pro Tour.
    </p>

    <p>
        We seek to promote and cultivate women playing Magic: the Gathering at a
        competitive level by sponsoring additional prizes that women can compete for
        in high level play and by keeping track of statistics of women's performances
        at the near-pro level.
    </p>

    <p>
        The top female competitor at every Grand Prix in North America in 2017 will
        receive a unique playmat with art by a featured artist, and in the next few months,
        we will be rolling out more exciting prizes, such as monetary winnings, fun merchandise
        (life counters, play sets of cards) and mentorship by some of our communityâ€™s beloved
        players and columnists!
